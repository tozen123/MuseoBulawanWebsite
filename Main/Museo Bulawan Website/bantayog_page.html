        <h1>1st Bantayog of Gat.Jose Rizal</h1>
        <h2>Jose Protacio Rizal, one of the martyrs during the Spanish colonial that fought for the rights<br>
            of a Filipino to have equal rights with the colonizers, laid down his life at Bagumbayan, now <br>
            famously known as Luneta Park in Manila. Yet a few of us know that there is an earlier monument <br>
            of Rizal and is the first of its kind. 
            <br>
            At Rizal Park in Daet, Camarines Norte of the Bicol Region stands the first Rizal Monument built February 1899. <br>
            It is in correspondence to the decree by the first president of the Republic of the Philippines, Emilio Aguinaldo to proclaim December 30, <br>
            1898 as the National Day of Mourning to commemorate the death of Jose Rizal in the hands of Spaniards, then, two years ago.
            <br>
            <br>
            Jose Rizal is the country's official national hero as enacted by a law proclaimed last 1902 by the Americans. This is in response<br>
            of the Philippines'new colonizers to pacify rebellion by using Rizal's life as a role model. Rizal fought for equal rights of native <br>
            Filipinos during the Spanish colonization era of the Philippines through peaceful means via literary works and journalism.
             <br>
             <br>
             The first Rizal Monument in Daet is three-sided where two of its sides features two of his famous novels, <br>
             the Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. These novels have intrinsically driven an expos√© about the ills <br>
             of the society during the Spanish colonial era in the Philippines and why there must be equality for the <br>
             Filipino natives. The literary works caused him to be punished in a four-year exile in a far-away land that <br>
             time which is in Dapitan, Zamboanga Del Norte. But his exile was escalated to death upon discovery of his <br>
             literary works at the headquarters of the Katipunan, a heavily leftist group that demands total independence<br>
             from Spain as lead by Andres Bonifacio. The Spaniards thought Jose Rizal was part of the Katipunan.
              <br>
              <br>
              The third side of the monument features Morga, who wrote Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas to where Rizal had <br>
              his inspiration in writing Noli Me Tangere  and El Filibusterismo
