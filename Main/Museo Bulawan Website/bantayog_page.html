        <h1>1st Bantayog of Gat.Jose Rizal</h1>
        <h2>Jose Protacio Rizal, one of the martyrs during the Spanish colonial that fought for the rights of a Filipino to have <br>
             equal rights with the colonizers, laid down his life at Bagumbayan, now famously known as Luneta Park in Manila. Yet <br>
             a few of us know that there is an earlier monument of Rizal and is the first of its kind. <br>
            <br>
            At Rizal Park in Daet, Camarines Norte of the Bicol Region stands the first Rizal Monument built February 1899. <br>
            It is in correspondence to the decree by the first president of the Republic of the Philippines, Emilio Aguinaldo <br>
            to proclaim December 30,1898 as the National Day of Mourning to commemorate the death of Jose Rizal in the hands of<br>
            Spaniards, then, two years ago.
            <br>
            <br>
            Jose Rizal is the country's official national hero as enacted by a law proclaimed last 1902 by the Americans. This <br>
            is in response of the Philippines'new colonizers to pacify rebellion by using Rizal's life as a role model. Rizal <br>
            fought for equal rights of native Filipinos during the Spanish colonization era of the Philippines through peaceful<br>
             means via literary works and journalism.
             <br>
             <br>
             The first Rizal Monument in Daet is three-sided where two of its sides features two of his famous novels, the Noli <br>
             Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo.These novels have intrinsically driven an expos√© about the ills of the society during <br>
             the Spanish colonial era in the Philippines and why there must be equality for the Filipino natives. The literary works <br>
             caused him to be punished in a four-year exile in a far-away land that time which is in Dapitan, Zamboanga Del Norte. But <br>
             his exile was escalated to death upon discovery of his literary works at the headquarters of the Katipunan, a heavily leftist <br>
              group that demands total independence from Spain as lead by Andres Bonifacio. The Spaniards thought Jose Rizal was part of the <br>
               Katipunan.
              <br>
              <br>
              The third side of the monument features Morga, who wrote Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas to where Rizal had his inspiration in <br>
              writing Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo
