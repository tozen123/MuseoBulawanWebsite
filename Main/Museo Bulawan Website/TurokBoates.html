            In 1927, he enrolled at the University of the Philippines and became a student leader par excellence. He excelled in forensics and oration. He was an awardee of the Manuel L. Quezon gold medal for excellence for his oration entitled “Malaysia Irredenta” and the Abad Santos medal for excellence in debate. He was editor-in-chief of the UP’s Philippine Collegian, president of the student council, and member of the Upsilon Sigma Phi fraternity.<br><br>
            In 1932, he led the youth movement in protest against the salary increase of the members of the Manila Municipal Council.<br><br>

        <h3>FRANCISCO “TURKO” D. BOAYES</h3>

        <h4>Francisco "Turko" Boayes, a Bicolano World War II hero and leader of famous 
            "VinzonsCommand" of Camarines Norte was the eldest son of Ishmael Ayyash,a 
            Syrian national of Jewish ancestry, who came to the Philippines with his two 
            businessmen counsins surnamed Abraham and Bichara. His Filipino mother was a 
            Spanish mestiza named Agapita Jimenez Dames of Daet.
            <br> 
            <br>
             

            When his father died, he lived a hard life doing odd jobs and helped support 
            his sisters with their material needs.He worked as a baggage boy in the market,
            thus developing physical strength, stamina and endurance which later on proved 
            to be his great personal asset.
            <br>
            <br>
            "Turko", as he was fondly called, was with the late Gov. Wencesclao Q. Vinzons
             as an aide, chaffeur and bodyguard, when the first shot was fired against the 
             Japanese Imperial Occupation forces in Camarines Norte from December 19, 1941
             to July 8, 1942.The Japanes invasion of Luzon was in full swing when Lt. Vinzons 
             assisted by his personal aide Sgt. Boayes raided enemy garrisons from January to<
             July of 1942.When Lt. Vinzons was captured and executed by the Japanese on July 8, 
             1942 in his camp in Tulay Na Lupa. "Turko" reorganized the guerilla unit and palced
             it under his command. Most celebrated example his bravery was a guerilla surprise attack
             to set free 30 Americans and Filipino prisoners of war who were about to executed in the 
             town of Naga. From regimental commander, he was promoted to the rank of Colonel.
            <br>
            <br>
            

            Finally, on June 13, 1968, in a ceremony camp Aguinaldo he was awarded the Gold Medal
            - the highest award to a war Veteran of World War II,which was personally conferred 
            by then Pres. Ferdinand E. Marcos, the crowning glory of his bravery and official recognition
            of his heroism.</h4>
