        <h3>FRANCISCO “TURKO” D. BOAYES</h3>

        <h4>Francisco "Turko" Boayes, a Bicolano World War II hero and leader of famous 
            "VinzonsCommand" of Camarines Norte<br> was the eldest son of Ishmael Ayyash,a 
            Syrian national of Jewish ancestry, who came to the Philippines with his two <br>
            businessmen counsins surnamed Abraham and Bichara. His Filipino mother was a 
            Spanish mestiza named Agapita <br>Jimenez Dames of Daet.
            <br> 
            <br>
             

            When his father died, he lived a hard life doing odd jobs and helped support 
            his sisters with their material needs.<br>He worked as a baggage boy in the market,
            thus developing physical strength, stamina and endurance which later<br> on proved 
            to be his great personal asset.
            <br>
            <br>
            "Turko", as he was fondly called, was with the late Gov. Wencesclao Q. Vinzons
             as an aide, chaffeur and bodyguard,<br> when the first shot was fired against the 
             Japanese Imperial Occupation forces in Camarines Norte from December 19, <br>1941
             to July 8, 1942.The Japanes invasion of Luzon was in full swing when Lt. Vinzons 
             assisted by his personal aide <br>Sgt. Boayes raided enemy garrisons from January to<
             July of 1942.When Lt. Vinzons was captured and executed by <br>the Japanese on July 8, 
             1942 in his camp in Tulay Na Lupa. "Turko" reorganized the guerilla unit and palced
             it under <br>his command. Most celebrated example his bravery was a guerilla surprise attack
             to set free 30 Americans and Filipino <br>prisoners of war who were about to executed in the 
             town of Naga. From regimental commander, he was promoted to <br>the rank of Colonel.
            <br>
            <br>
            

            Finally, on June 13, 1968, in a ceremony camp Aguinaldo he was awarded the Gold Medal
            - the highest award <br>to a war Veteran of World War II,which was personally conferred 
            by then Pres. Ferdinand E. Marcos, the crowning <br>glory of his bravery and official recognition
            of his heroism.</h4>
