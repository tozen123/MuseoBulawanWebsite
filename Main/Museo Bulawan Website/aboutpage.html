        <h1>About Our Museo</h1>
        <p><br><br>The Community Museum of Camarines Norte was originally conceptualized upon the construction of the new provincial capitol building way back in 1995. The neo-classical design of the new building was a throwback to the grandeur of antiquity because of its Greco-roman architecture which blended very well with the idea of putting up a museum.<br><br><br>

            Consequently, a space was allotted for the museum, which was located at the middle portion of the frontage of the capitol building facing the main entrance, as a venue of various periodic exhibits, the small space for the museum served as the most productive ground for information, education and communication activities of the provincial government aimed at improving the level of culture and consciousness of young and old alike.<br><br>
            
            The National Commission for Culture and the Arts, the National Museum as well as the National Historical Institute have been very instrumental in implementing a good number of activities of the provincial government related to history, culture and arts thereby stoking a great interest among the local people to provide a sharp focus on their own local history and heritage which enhanced even more their sense of identity and sense of national purpose.<br><br>

        <p>
            Over the years, after having done many activities and exhibits in the museum, it was observed that the space of said museum inside the capitol building was very much wanting as shown by cramped arrangement of materials. And so, it was deemed necessary that the museum be transferred to a bigger space. Subsequently, the museum was transferred upon the advent of the new millennium in the year 2000 to a building juxtaposed to the provincial capitol building so as to accommodate more materials and more viewers of the exhibits.<br><br>
            
            There was indeed a tremendous improvement in terms of collections as well as the presentation of museum materials because of a better location and a bigger space. Because of this, a more systematic technique in museum maintenance, documentation, research and preservation was put in place. Besides, there had been also a massive campaign for marketing and promotion so as to increase the number of clientele that the museum serves.<br><br>
            
            Considering that the distinction of the province of Camarines Norte is its being a place that sits on gold, so to speak, the Provincial Community Museum of Camarines Norte eventually came to be known as Museo Bulawan which means “golden museum”. As of now, the museum conducts periodic exhibits, holds various activities for children and adults, keeps collections such as numismatics, a set of portraits of governors, computer generated panels showing significant moments in our history and an exhibit on local heroes. Similarly, this museum serves as a show window of the rich cultural heritage and scenic spots of the province of amarines Norte and thus provides an added dimension to the tourism package being offered among travelers and visitors.

        <h4>Museum Curator</h4>
        <p class="para1">
            Through the pages of history we saw the searing revolutionary fire of the nationalist heroes of Camarines Norte
            who convulsed in a determined uprising in Daet in April 1898 and later established the First Rizal Monument in
            December of that year. The seeds of freedom sown by the local heroes of this Province engendered an awakened
            nation and a people who were wont to pay the price of freedom. Through the wars and dictatorship, the people
            of Camarines Norte seasoned the challenges with perseverance and fortitude.<br><br>

            Museo Bulawan, which is a community museum, attempts to capture the rich panorama of struggle of the Local people.
            History aside, Museo Bulawan, showcases as well the exquisite treasure of this province which is gold. Actually,
            bulawan is a Filipino word for gold and it is said that Camarines Norte is a province that sits in a mound of gold.<br><br>

            Not only does the Provincial Government of Camarines Norte mind itself on the material development of the people but more so,
            it strives to zero in on the software of social and economic development which is the cultural, ethical and moral upliftment
            of the people. And there is no other way by which this can be effectively done except through the powerful tool of culture
            and arts.

        <p class="para2">
            Hence, genuine socio -economic progress becomes possible through the developmental firepower of culture clarified and inculcated in the minds and hearts of the people.<br><br>

            Museo Bulawan is dynamically spearheading this thrust on cultural development being at the forefront of heritage, cultural and artistic endeavors of the local government.
            And we hold the conviction that cultural development is the ultimate driving force to continually rekindle and spread courage, resiliency, integrity, moral strength and 
            patriotic and nationalistic fervor.
