            Through the pages of history we saw the searing revolutionary fire of the nationalist heroes of Camarines Norte
            who convulsed in a determined uprising in Daet in April 1898 and later established the First Rizal Monument in
            December of that year. The seeds of freedom sown by the local heroes of this Province engendered an awakened
            nation and a people who were wont to pay the price of freedom. Through the wars and dictatorship, the people
            of Camarines Norte seasoned the challenges with perseverance and fortitude.<br><br>

            Museo Bulawan, which is a community museum, attempts to capture the rich panorama of struggle of the Local people.
            History aside, Museo Bulawan, showcases as well the exquisite treasure of this province which is gold. Actually,
            bulawan is a Filipino word for gold and it is said that Camarines Norte is a province that sits in a mound of gold.<br><br>

            Not only does the Provincial Government of Camarines Norte mind itself on the material development of the people but more so,
            it strives to zero in on the software of social and economic development which is the cultural, ethical and moral upliftment
            of the people. And there is no other way by which this can be effectively done except through the powerful tool of culture
            and arts.
