        <h1>WENCESLAO Q. VINZONS <br>(1910-1942)</h1>
        <p>
            Born on September 28, 1910, at Indan (now Vinzons), Camarines Norte, he had manifested signs of extraordinary brilliance at an early age. He went to school at six, finishing his elementary and high school as class valedictorian in less time than required.<br><br>
            He is the son of Gabino V. Vinzons and Engracia Quinito, He took his elementary education in his hometown and finished his secondary education at the Camarines Norte High School as valedictorian. He obtained his Bachelor of Laws from the University of the Philippines.<br><br>
            In 1927, he enrolled at the University of the Philippines and became a student leader par excellence. He excelled in forensics and oration. He was an awardee of the Manuel L. Quezon gold medal for excellence for his oration entitled “Malaysia Irredenta” and the Abad Santos medal for excellence in debate. He was editor-in-chief of the UP’s Philippine Collegian, president of the student council, and member of the Upsilon Sigma Phi fraternity.<br><br>
            In 1932, he led the youth movement in protest against the salary increase of the members of the Manila Municipal Council.<br><br>
            In his junior year, he edited the Philippine Collegian, co-founded the College Editors Guild, and became its first president. As president of the UP-Student Council, he led demonstrations against the now infamous “Festin Rider,” an attempt by the legislators to increase their salary.

        <p>
            In 1933, he placed third in the bar examination. He won a seat in the Constitutional Convention in 1934 at the age of 23. He was voted most outstanding young man in politics before the war. He founded the young Philippines Party , Together with Arturo Tolentino, Teodoro Kalaw, Lorenzo Sumulong, Carmen Planas and Avelina Lorenzana (now Mrs. Camilo Osias), he waged an incessant campaign for clean government and autonomy.<br><br>
            On July 10, 1934, he won a seat in the Constitutional Convention and became the youngest signer of the Constitution.<br><br>
            He was one of those responsible for making Tagalog the national language of the Filipinos. In the 19335 elections, he supported General Emilio Aguinaldo for presidency against President Manuel L. Quezon. He went from province to province explaining the necessity of having a balanced two-party system to prevent abuses, corruption and inefficiency in governmental affairs. Bitterly critical of the administration, he was charged with libel and sedition after the election. The Cavite Court of the First Instance sentenced him to jail, but the Court of Appeals acquitted him.

            Through the pages of history we saw the searing revolutionary fire of the nationalist heroes of Camarines Norte
            who convulsed in a determined uprising in Daet in April 1898 and later established the First Rizal Monument in
            December of that year. The seeds of freedom sown by the local heroes of this Province engendered an awakened
            nation and a people who were wont to pay the price of freedom. Through the wars and dictatorship, the people
            of Camarines Norte seasoned the challenges with perseverance and fortitude.<br><br>

            Museo Bulawan, which is a community museum, attempts to capture the rich panorama of struggle of the Local people.
            History aside, Museo Bulawan, showcases as well the exquisite treasure of this province which is gold. Actually,
            bulawan is a Filipino word for gold and it is said that Camarines Norte is a province that sits in a mound of gold.<br><br>

            Not only does the Provincial Government of Camarines Norte mind itself on the material development of the people but more so,
            it strives to zero in on the software of social and economic development which is the cultural, ethical and moral upliftment
            of the people. And there is no other way by which this can be effectively done except through the powerful tool of culture
            and arts.
